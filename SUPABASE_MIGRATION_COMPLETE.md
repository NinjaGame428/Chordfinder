## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Development Server
The dev server is already running, but if you need to restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Your Browser
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/songs`
2. **Hard refresh** the page to clear cache:
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Step 3: Check the Console
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. You should see logs like:
   ```
   🔄 Starting to fetch songs from Supabase...

2. You should see all 79 artists from the database
3. Each artist card shows their song count

### Step 5: Test the Test Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/test-db`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If songs don't appear:

1. **Check console for errors** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://zsujkjbvliqphssuvvyw.supabase.co
   - Table Editor → songs → Verify 170 rows exist
   - Table Editor → artists → Verify 79 rows exist

4. **Run verification script**:
   ```bash
   node verify-frontend-connection.js
   ```

5. **Check RLS policies**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Authentication → Policies
   - Verify "Public can view all songs" and "Public can view all artists" policies exist

### If you see "Supabase client not initialized":
- Check `.env.local` file has all three keys
- Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`

### If you see "0 songs found":
- Run the import script: `node add-youtube-songs.js`
- Or check if songs exist: `node test-db-connection.js`
